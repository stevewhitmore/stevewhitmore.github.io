                <h1>Steve Whitmore.</h1>
                <p>I've been working as a software developer and architect for 9+ years with duties ranging from system administration and building custom WordPress plugins to building and maintaining a suite of Angular libraries. Currently I'm focused on expanding my 5+ years of Angular experience by leading cutting edge projects and writing <a routerLink="/blatherings">technical articles</a> for the public to enjoy.</p>
                <p>Based out of Kansas City, I love building pipelines and rapidly delivering high quality software for my peers and customers alike.</p>
